            I was born and raised in Lucknow, completed my education at City Montessori School, and will soon graduate from Manipal University in Jaipur with a bachelor's degree. Overall, the current score is 8.89. I've developed and designed websites for a variety of businesses. Capable of coding and having a good work-team or solo performance. Presently working as a website development intern for a company. I am a major fan of artificial intelligence (obviously influenced by Iron Man a.k.a Tony Stark a.k.a RDJ), and I also enjoy learning about space and a little history as well.
